# Ravn Test Automation Live Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to showcase good practices in structuring Playwright tests:
- Keep locators and actions inside dedicated Page Object files.  
- Reuse shared functionality in a `BasePage`.  
- Keep tests clean and focused only on verifying behavior.
